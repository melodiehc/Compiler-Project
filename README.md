# Mini Compiler

This is a mini compiler for a subset of the C language built as part of our Programming language/Implementation course (CS361)


It is currently being built as a series of four incremental phases, each contributing a key part of the compiler.

|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project-1 | Building a lexical analyzer using Lex for a subset of C language to tokenize a given program |
| Project-2 | Build a parser by reading tokens from the lexical analyzer from Project 1. |
| Project-3 |Build a semantic analyzer for the context free grammar implemented in Project 2.|
