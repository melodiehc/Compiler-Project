## Build a parser by reading tokens from the lexical analyzer from Project 1.

The Compiler.java file contains a Parser class that is responsible for parsing the tokenized code and constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based on the structure and rules defined in the class. Here are some key points on how the Parser acts as a parser:

1. **Tokenization**: The Parser class takes the tokenized code (generated by the LexicalAnalyzer) as input. The tokenized code consists of tokens categorized into different types such as keywords, identifiers, constants, operators, etc.

2. **Building the AST**: The parseProgram method in the Parser class iterates through the tokens and constructs an AST node by node based on the grammar rules. It identifies constructs like functions, blocks, keywords, etc., and organizes them in a hierarchical tree structure.

3. **Handling Code Blocks**: The Parser identifies the start and end of code blocks (using curly braces '{' and '}') to create nested blocks within the AST. This helps in representing the code structure accurately in the tree.

4. **Tree Traversal**: The Parser uses recursive traversal techniques to navigate through the AST and construct the tree in the correct order. It moves between parent and child nodes based on the token sequence and block structures in the code.

5. **Printing the AST**: The ASTNode class provides methods to print the AST in a readable format, showing the hierarchy of nodes and their relationships.

Overall, the Parser class in this compiler acts as a parser by analyzing the tokenized code, interpreting the code structure, and constructing an AST representation that captures the syntax and semantics of the input C code. This AST serves as a structured representation of the code that can be further processed for compilation or analysis purposes.
